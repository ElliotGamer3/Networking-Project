# File Structure

Code is hosted in the src folder. the tests folder contains a copy of the src file structure and a folder for each corresponding file in the src folder that contains tests for the file. For example, a file in the src directory with the path of `/src/foo/bar.py` would have tests 1 and 2 located at `/tests/foo/bar/bar_1_test.py` and `/tests/foo/bar/bar_2_test.py`.
